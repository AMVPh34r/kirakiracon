							Our dress code policies are not strict, as we encourage creativity and self-expression with costumes, cosplays, and clothing. However, because this is a public, all-age event, and because it is held on a college campus, we do have a few dress code regulations which we enforce, and clothing or signs that contain distasteful or offensive words or images or promote pedophilia are strictly prohibited. Proper footwear should be worn at all times. Short skirts and dresses should be accompanied by proper underwear. Inability to wear proper underwear beneath short skirts and dresses is constituted as indecent exposure, and offenders will be turned over to UNCC's security officers and campus police.
